        of Hong Kong (CUHK) in 2020. Before joining SEU, he was a Postdoctoral
        Fellow in the Department of Mechanical and Automation Engineering at
        CUHK. He has published more than 40 papers in peer-reviewed journals,
        including Science Advances, Science Robotics, Nature Communications, ACS
        Nano and IEEE Transactions series (T-CYBER, T-MECH, T-ASE, T-BME), and
        presented his work in IEEE ICRA, IROS .etc. Several of his journal
        papers have been indexed as ESI Highly Cited Papers and Hot Papers (Top
        0.1%) and have been highlighted in Nature News and international press
        reports. His research focuses on the micro-/nano-robotics field,
        including collective behaviors of micro/nanorobots, medical
        imaging-guided delivery, and micromanipulation. He has been selected
        into National High-level Young Scholar Program (overseas).
